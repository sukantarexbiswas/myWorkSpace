Dekha hobe abar(See you again)

Today is my last day working day with all you lovely people, and it makes me terribly sad - or does it? 

Yes, while I did spend each day with you guys breathing down my neck, I enjoyed every day that went by and prayed that the next day passed off faster. Nevertheless, now that I am off, I am happy and so must be you. 

You know I am joking, and how I feel about leaving this place that you guys made into a second home for me. I will miss each of you. 

I am heading off to explore new challenges in my career and all I need is your blessings. Wish all of you best of luck. I hope we can be still in touch with each other. If you ever want to get in touch, my contact info is below. This isnâ€™t goodbye, our paths will cross again.
